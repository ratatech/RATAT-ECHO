# RATAT-ECHO

This repository containse mainly the PCB design files for a small echo effect unit. The circuit it's mainly composed by two major blocks, the echo and the spring reverb drive/recovery circuits. 

The echo module is basically an adaptation of the echo circuit included in PT2399 echo processor [datasheet](./datasheets/).
